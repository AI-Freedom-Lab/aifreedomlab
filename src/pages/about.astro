      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        AI Freedom Lab emerged from a simple observation: as artificial intelligence becomes more powerful
        and pervasive, the way we access and control these systems will fundamentally shape the future of
        human autonomy and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in Nashville, Tennessee, at <a href={BITCOIN_PARK_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin Park</a>,
        our community brings together developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and concerned citizens who
        believe that intelligence tools should serve individuals, not centralized platforms.
      </p>

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We're building a future where everyone can access, control, and benefit from AI technology without
        surrendering their privacy, data, or autonomy to centralized services.
      </p>
      <p class="font-semibold text-xl text-primary-cyan">
        Intelligence freedom means the ability to think, create, and make decisions using AI tools that
        you truly control.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">What We Believe</h2>
      <ul class="space-y-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Self-custody is fundamental:</strong> Just as Bitcoin enables financial sovereignty,
          self-custodial AI enables intellectual sovereignty. You should be able to run models on your
          own hardware, with your own data, under your own control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Privacy is non-negotiable:</strong> Your thoughts, questions, and creative processes
          shouldn't be training data for someone else's business model. Local AI keeps your data local.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open-source empowers everyone:</strong> The most powerful AI systems should be freely
          available, inspectable, and modifiable. Open-source AI levels the playing field and prevents
          monopolistic control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community builds resilience:</strong> By sharing knowledge, tools, and best practices,
          we make self-custodial AI accessible to everyone, not just technical experts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimism drives innovation:</strong> We're builders, not cynics. The future of AI
          can be bright, sovereign, and empowering—if we build it together.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">The Custodial Framework</h2>
      <p>
        We think about AI systems across a spectrum of control:
      </p>
      <div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 my-8">
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-2 border-primary-cyan">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-cyan mb-3">Self-Custodial</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            You run the model on your hardware. You control the weights, the data, and the inference.
            Maximum sovereignty, maximum privacy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-2 border-accent-orange">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-accent-orange mb-3">Collaborative</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Shared infrastructure with trusted peers. Local first, cloud when needed. Balance between
            convenience and control.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-md border-2 border-primary-black/30">
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-3">Centralized</h3>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Convenient, powerful, but opaque. Your data, questions, and usage patterns belong to
            someone else.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Our focus is on making self-custodial and collaborative AI accessible, practical, and empowering.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Our Relationship with Bitcoin Park</h2>
      <p>
        AI Freedom Lab is proudly incubated at <a href={BITCOIN_PARK_URL} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin Park</a>,
        a community-driven hub for Bitcoin education, development, and culture in Nashville.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principles that guide Bitcoin—decentralization, self-custody, open-source development, and
        individual sovereignty—directly inspired our approach to AI. Just as Bitcoin separates money from
        state, we're working to separate intelligence from centralized platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bitcoin Park provides us with space, community, and shared values. Many of our events, workshops,
        and hackathons take place at the Park, and we're grateful for their support.
      </p>
