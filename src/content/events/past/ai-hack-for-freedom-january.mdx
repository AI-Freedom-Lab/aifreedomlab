# AI Hack for Freedom - January 2025

Our inaugural hackathon brought together 35 developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts for two days of intensive building focused on self-custodial AI.

## Event Recap

The energy at Bitcoin Park was incredible. Teams worked on everything from local model deployment tools to privacy-preserving AI infrastructure, guided by the principle that intelligence should be free and sovereign.

### What We Built

**Five teams shipped working projects:**

1. **Sovereign LLM Dashboard** - A web UI for managing multiple local AI models with resource monitoring
2. **Private Document Chat** - RAG system for querying personal documents without cloud services
3. **Federated Model Router** - Smart routing between local and collaborative AI infrastructure
4. **AI Privacy Toolkit** - Scripts and configurations for securing local AI deployments
5. **Local Voice Assistant** - Whisper + local LLM for completely private voice interaction

### Highlights

- All five teams demoed working code
- New collaborations formed that continued beyond the event
- Knowledge sharing on quantization, model optimization, and deployment
- Copious amounts of coffee consumed
- Zero vendor pitches, 100% building

### Community Feedback

> "This was the first hackathon I've been to where everyone was genuinely excited about the mission, not just winning prizes." - Attendee

> "I learned more about local AI in two days than I had in the previous two months." - First-time participant

> "The vibe was perfect - collaborative, not competitive. Everyone helped each other debug." - Team lead

## Key Takeaways

1. **Self-custodial AI is ready**: The tools exist, the models work, and people are excited
2. **Community matters**: Shared values (privacy, sovereignty, freedom) create amazing energy
3. **Education is critical**: Many attendees were new to local AI and left empowered
4. **We're just getting started**: Every project sparked ideas for the next one

## What's Next

Based on feedback, we're planning:

- Monthly hands-on workshops at Bitcoin Park
- Open-source repo for sharing hackathon projects
- Follow-up session to help teams continue their projects
- Regional chapters for other cities
