# SXSW Meetup: Vibe Coding for Freedom

Join us during SXSW for an afternoon of collaborative coding, learning, and building with self-custodial AI.

## What to Expect

This isn't your typical conference talk. We're gathering builders, thinkers, and anyone curious about AI sovereignty for a hands-on session where we'll:

- **Ship something real**: Bring your project or start a new one
- **Learn from each other**: Share techniques for local AI deployment
- **Vibe**: Build in a collaborative, low-pressure environment
- **Connect**: Meet fellow believers in intelligence freedom

## Schedule

- **2:00 PM** - Welcome & intro to AI Freedom Lab
- **2:30 PM** - Lightning talks (5 min each, share what you're working on)
- **3:00 PM** - Collaborative coding session
- **5:00 PM** - Demo what you built
- **5:30 PM** - Wrap-up & networking

## Who Should Come

- Developers interested in local AI
- Privacy advocates
- Bitcoin enthusiasts (many parallels!)
- Anyone curious about self-custodial technology
- SXSW attendees looking for a builder-focused event

## What to Bring

- Your laptop
- A project idea (or work on ours!)
- Questions about local AI
- Good vibes

## Projects We Might Work On

- Setting up local AI infrastructure
- Building privacy-preserving AI tools
- Integrating local models with existing apps
