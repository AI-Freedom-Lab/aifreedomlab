# Welcome to AI Freedom Lab

We're excited to introduce AI Freedom Lab, a new movement dedicated to building intelligence freedom through self-custodial AI.

## Why We're Here

As AI becomes increasingly central to how we think, create, and make decisions, we face a critical choice: Will these powerful tools be controlled by a handful of centralized platforms, or will they empower individuals and communities?

At AI Freedom Lab, we believe the answer should be clear. **Intelligence tools should serve you, not surveil you.**

## Our Vision

We're building a future where:

- **Anyone can run AI models locally** on their own hardware
- **Privacy is the default**, not a premium feature
- **Open-source AI** levels the playing field
- **Communities collaborate** to make self-custodial AI accessible to everyone

## What We Do

AI Freedom Lab brings together developers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and anyone curious about AI sovereignty. Through hackathons, workshops, and community events, we're:

1. **Educating** people about self-custodial AI and why it matters
2. **Building** tools and infrastructure for local AI deployment
3. **Connecting** builders and creating a supportive community
4. **Advocating** for intelligence freedom as a fundamental right

## Join Us

Whether you're a seasoned AI engineer or just getting started, there's a place for you in our community. We host regular events in Nashville at Bitcoin Park, and we're always looking for contributors, speakers, and builders.

**Check out our [upcoming events](/events)** or **[get in touch](/contact)** to learn more.

Together, we're building a future where intelligence is free, open, and empowering.

Welcome to the movement.
