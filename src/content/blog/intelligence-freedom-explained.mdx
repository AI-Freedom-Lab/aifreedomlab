# What is Intelligence Freedom?

Intelligence freedom is the ability to access, use, and benefit from AI tools without surrendering your privacy, data, or autonomy to centralized platforms.

## The Problem with Centralized AI

Today, most people interact with AI through centralized services like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. While these tools are powerful and convenient, they come with significant trade-offs:

### Privacy Loss
Every question you ask, every document you upload, every creative work you generate becomes data for someone else's business model. Your intellectual process is no longer private.

### Dependency
When you rely on a centralized service, you're subject to:
- Price increases
- Terms of service changes
- Service outages
- Account suspensions
- Censorship

### Power Concentration
A small number of companies control the most advanced AI systems, creating new forms of technological dependency and power imbalance.

## The Alternative: Self-Custodial AI

Self-custodial AI means running models on your own hardware, with your own data, under your complete control.

### How It Works

1. **Download open-source models** (like LLaMA, Mistral, or others from Hugging Face)
2. **Run them locally** on your computer or server
3. **Keep your data private** - nothing leaves your device
4. **Maintain full control** - no one can take away your access

### Benefits

- **Privacy**: Your thoughts, questions, and creative work stay private
- **Sovereignty**: You control the tools, not the other way around
- **Censorship resistance**: No one can restrict what you can ask or create
- **Cost predictability**: No monthly fees or usage limits
- **Availability**: Works offline, no internet required

## The Custodial Spectrum

Not all AI systems are created equal. We think about AI on a spectrum:

### Self-Custodial
You run the model on your hardware. Maximum sovereignty, maximum privacy.

**Examples:**
- Running Ollama on your laptop
- Self-hosted LocalAI instance
- PrivateGPT for document analysis

### Collaborative
Shared infrastructure with trusted peers. Balance between convenience and control.

**Examples:**
- Community-run AI servers
- Federated model hosting
- Local-first, cloud-optional

### Centralized
Convenient and powerful, but opaque. Your data belongs to someone else.

**Examples:**
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Gemini

## Why This Matters Now

AI is becoming infrastructure. Just as Bitcoin showed us that money could be decentralized and self-custodial, open-source AI shows us that intelligence tools can be too.

The question isn't whether AI will reshape society—it will. The question is: **Who will control it?**

## Getting Started
